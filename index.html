  <h1>Chicken Biryani Recipe</h1>
  
  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 kg Chicken (bone-in, cleaned and cut into medium pieces)</li>
    <li>2 cups Basmati rice (soaked for 30 minutes)</li>
    <li>1 cup Yogurt (curd)</li>
    <li>3 large Onions (thinly sliced)</li>
    <li>2 Tomatoes (chopped)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons Ginger-Garlic paste</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons Red chili powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon Turmeric powder</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons Biryani masala or Garam masala</li>
    <li>4 Green chilies (slit)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup Mint leaves</li>
    <li>1/2 cup Coriander leaves</li>
    <li>Whole spices: 2 bay leaves, 4 cloves, 4 cardamoms, 1 cinnamon stick</li>
    <li>Saffron strands soaked in 2 tablespoons warm milk (or yellow food color)</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons Cooking oil or ghee (clarified butter)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Instructions:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Fry the Onions:</strong> Heat oil or ghee in a large pot. Add sliced onions and fry until golden brown. Remove half of the fried onions and set them aside for layering later.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Marinate the Chicken:</strong> In a bowl, mix chicken with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric, biryani masala, salt, and half of the fried onions. Let it marinate for 30 minutes to 2 hours for best flavor.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Cook the Chicken:</strong> In the same pot, add whole spices and let them sizzle. Add chopped tomatoes and cook for 2–3 minutes. Then add the marinated chicken. Cook on medium heat until the chicken is tender and the oil separates.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Boil the Rice:</strong> In a separate large pot, boil water with salt. Add soaked basmati rice and cook until it's 70% cooked (not fully soft). Drain the water completely.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Layering:</strong> Spread the cooked chicken evenly in the pot. Add chopped mint, coriander leaves, green chilies, and the remaining fried onions on top. Then spread the partially cooked rice over the chicken.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Final Topping:</strong> Sprinkle saffron milk (or food color) on top. You can also add 1 tablespoon ghee on top for rich flavor.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Dum (Steam Cooking):</strong> Cover the pot with a tight lid. Cook on high heat for 5 minutes, then on low flame for 20–25 minutes. (Place a tawa under the pot for even heat if needed.)</li>
    
    <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Gently mix from the sides before serving. Serve hot with raita (yogurt), salad, or chutney.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p><strong>Tip:</strong> For extra aroma, add a few drops of kewra or rose water before closing the lid for dum.</p>
